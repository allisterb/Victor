    /// <summary>
    /// A BuildPostCommitSpec holds a build post commit hook specification.
    /// The hook executes a command in a temporary container running the
    /// build output image, immediately after the last layer of the image is
    /// committed and before the image is pushed to a registry. The command
    /// is executed with the current working directory ($PWD) set to the
    /// image's WORKDIR.
    /// 
    /// The build will be marked as failed if the hook execution fails. It
    /// will fail if the script or command return a non-zero exit code, or if
    /// there is any other error related to starting the temporary container.
    /// 
    /// There are five different ways to configure the hook. As an example,
    /// all forms below are equivalent and will execute `rake test --verbose`.
    /// 
    /// 1. Shell script:
    /// 
    /// "postCommit": {
    /// "script": "rake test --verbose",
    /// }
    /// 
    /// The above is a convenient form which is equivalent to:
    /// 
    /// "postCommit": {
    /// "command": ["/bin/sh", "-ic"],
    /// "args":    ["rake test --verbose"]
    /// }
    /// 
    /// 2. A command as the image entrypoint:
    /// 
    /// "postCommit": {
    /// "commit": ["rake", "test", "--verbose"]
    /// }
    /// 
    /// Command overrides the image entrypoint in the exec form, as
    /// documented in
    /// Docker:
    /// https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#entrypoint.
    /// 
    /// 3. Pass arguments to the default entrypoint:
    /// 
    /// "postCommit": {
    /// "args": ["rake", "test", "--verbose"]
    /// }
    /// 
    /// This form is only useful if the image entrypoint can handle
    /// arguments.
    /// 
    /// 4. Shell script with arguments:
    /// 
    /// "postCommit": {
    /// "script": "rake test $1",
    /// "args":   ["--verbose"]
    /// }
    /// 
    /// This form is useful if you need to pass arguments that would
    /// otherwise be
    /// hard to quote properly in the shell script. In the script, $0 will
    /// be
    /// "/bin/sh" and $1, $2, etc, are the positional arguments from Args.
    /// 
    /// 5. Command with arguments:
    /// 
    /// "postCommit": {
    /// "command": ["rake", "test"],
    /// "args":    ["--verbose"]
    /// }
    /// 
    /// This form is equivalent to appending the arguments to the Command
    /// slice.
    /// 
    /// It is invalid to provide both Script and Command simultaneously. If
    /// none of the fields are specified, the hook is not executed.
