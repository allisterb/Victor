    /// <summary>
    /// OpenShift provides builds, application lifecycle, image content
    /// management,
    /// and administrative policy on top of Kubernetes. The API allows
    /// consistent
    /// management of those objects.
    /// 
    /// All API operations are authenticated via an Authorization	bearer token
    /// that
    /// is provided for service accounts as a generated secret (in JWT form)
    /// or via
    /// the native OAuth endpoint located at /oauth/authorize. Core
    /// infrastructure
    /// components may use client certificates that require no authentication.
    /// 
    /// All API operations return a 'resourceVersion' string that represents
    /// the
    /// version of the object in the underlying storage. The standard LIST
    /// operation
    /// performs a snapshot read of the underlying objects, returning a
    /// resourceVersion
    /// representing a consistent version of the listed objects. The WATCH
    /// operation
    /// allows all updates to a set of objects after the provided
    /// resourceVersion to
    /// be observed by a client. By listing and beginning a watch from the
    /// returned
    /// resourceVersion, clients may observe a consistent view of the state of
    /// one
    /// or more objects. Note that WATCH always returns the update after the
    /// provided
    /// resourceVersion. Watch may be extended a limited time in the past -
    /// using
    /// etcd 2 the watch window is 1000 events (which on a large cluster may
    /// only
    /// be a few tens of seconds) so clients must explicitly handle the "watch
    /// to old error" by re-listing.
    /// 
    /// Objects are divided into two rough categories - those that have a
    /// lifecycle
    /// and must reflect the state of the cluster, and those that have no
    /// state.
    /// Objects with lifecycle typically have three main sections:
    /// 
    /// * 'metadata' common to all objects
    /// * a 'spec' that represents the desired state
    /// * a 'status' that represents how much of the desired state is
    /// reflected on
    /// the cluster at the current time
    /// 
    /// Objects that have no state have 'metadata' but may lack a 'spec' or
    /// 'status'
    /// section.
    /// 
    /// Objects are divided into those that are namespace scoped (only exist
    /// inside
    /// of a namespace) and those that are cluster scoped (exist outside of
    /// a namespace). A namespace scoped resource will be deleted when the
    /// namespace
    /// is deleted and cannot be created if the namespace has not yet been
    /// created
    /// or is in the process of deletion. Cluster scoped resources are
    /// typically
    /// only accessible to admins - resources like nodes, persistent volumes,
    /// and
    /// cluster policy.
    /// 
    /// All objects have a schema that is a combination of the 'kind' and
    /// 'apiVersion' fields. This schema is additive only for any given
    /// version -
    /// no backwards incompatible changes are allowed without incrementing the
    /// apiVersion. The server will return and accept a number of standard
    /// responses that share a common schema - for instance, the common
    /// error type is 'metav1.Status' (described below) and will be returned
    /// on any error from the API server.
    /// 
    /// The API is available in multiple serialization formats - the default is
    /// JSON (Accept: application/json and Content-Type: application/json) but
    /// clients may also use YAML (application/yaml) or the native Protobuf
    /// schema (application/vnd.kubernetes.protobuf). Note that the format
    /// of the WATCH API call is slightly different - for JSON it returns
    /// newline
    /// delimited objects while for Protobuf it returns length-delimited frames
    /// (4 bytes in network-order) that contain a 'versioned.Watch' Protobuf
    /// object.
